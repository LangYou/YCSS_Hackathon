## Event Description
YCSS Hackathon 2019 is an online grass-roots hackathon organised by the Y Combinator Startup School community, for the community. In the spirit of collaboration and getting things done, we are inviting all YCSS-affiliated coders, designers, product managers and entrepreneurs to hack together and turbocharge your development. 

If you are looking to go from idea to prototype, for potential founders or even just ideas, this is a perfect opportunity for you to meet other members of this global community. 

If you are not ready to hack, you may still sign up as audience, help out as mentors with domain expertise, or offer related [YCSSer Products](#ycsser-products) that might help fellow participants.
